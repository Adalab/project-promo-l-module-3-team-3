##  Using React, we have refactored  the code of a functional website for making digital business cards, that was initially created with Vanilla JavaScript.

---



The main idea of this project was to learn to `work with legacy code`, something that often happens in the programming world, developing our ability to modify code created by other people and making us aware of the importance of creating good code.  
## Used Technologies ![](https://github.com/Adalab/project-promo-l-module-3-team-3/blob/dev/src/images/4readme/sasspk.png) ![](https://github.com/Adalab/project-promo-l-module-3-team-3/blob/dev/src/images/4readme/react.png)  ![](https://github.com/Adalab/project-promo-l-module-3-team-3/blob/dev/src/images/4readme/github.png) 
- Sass for styling.
- ES6 and React for structuring the application JavaScript.
- Git for version control, using branches.
- Publication on the Internet using GitHub Pages.
In addition, we have implemented the following new features:
- Transitions and/or animations to improve interactions with the application.
- Navigation between the different pages of the application using React router.

## Steps we followed:
#### :mag: Project analysis 
-  Create a new repo with the React project
-  Create, inside such repo, a folder with version 0 (legacy code).
-  Analyse and test the code and understand its structure in order to adapt it to our needs and knowledge.
-  Fix bugs detected in the code.
-  Implement improvements in the legacy code, without modifying the functionality. 
##### üìã React Layout
-  Define the React component structure of the application.
-  Generate the components of the project and communicate information through props.
-  Create branches to work on the different components and avoid touching the master branch. 
##### ‚öõÔ∏è React Full version
-  Perform interactivity, using React state and events.
-  Implement communication with the backend, sharing and offline.
-  Create landing page.
-  Implement routing with React router. 
## Scripts to start the project 
- You need to have Node.js ![](https://github.com/Adalab/project-promo-l-module-3-team-3/blob/dev/src/images/4readme/node.jpg)
- Clone or download this repo and open your code editor.
- To install the dependencies:   
`npm install`
- To run the app in the development mode.\   
`npm start`  
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- To publish to production ("build && rm -rf docs/ && mv build/ docs/* && git commit -m 'Update github pages' && git push") :    
`npm run docs-and-push`
